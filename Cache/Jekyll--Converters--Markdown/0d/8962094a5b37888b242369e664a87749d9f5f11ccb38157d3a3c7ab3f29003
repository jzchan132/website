<ul>
  <li>Implemented deep learning models for various computer vision and NLP tasks, using Keras and TensorFlow.</li>
  <li>Trained deep learning models, using both cloud (Google Colab, Google Compute Engine) and university GPU servers.</li>
  <li>Extracted insights from real-world datasets, using spreadsheet tools like conditional/lookup functions and pivot tables.

<em>Software Engineering Intern</em> <br />
June 2019 - Aug. 2019  |  Gaithersburg, MD <br /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Open Sesame is an in-house Android app for wirelessly managing building access, especially during o-hours. Users on the
buildingâ€™s network can easily control physical door locks via the Open Sesame app.</li>
  <li>Independently revamped Open Sesameâ€™s codebase (C#, Xamarin) to patch existing login vulnerabilities and make the app
compatible with Android 8.1.</li>
  <li>Regularly met with both technical and non-technical collaborators to discuss design specifications, present progress
updates, and obtain user experience feedback.

<ul>
  <li>Designed an algorithm for automatically reorienting laser communication gimbals in military vehicles, in order to maximize
inter-vehicle signal strength in the battlefield. Implemented the gimbal adjustment algorithm using C++.

<p><strong>U.S. Army Research Laboratory</strong> <br />
<em>Research Intern</em> <br />
June 2017 - Aug. 2017  |  Adelphi, MD \</p>
<ul>
  <li>Built a Python+LabOne based laser system to automate the laborious process of locating spin defects in silicon carbide
samples. Such spin defects are useful for many applications, such as quantum computing, cryptography, and bioimaging.</li>
  <li>Created an intuitive GUI with Tkinter and Matplotlib to help a team of physicists easily run the laser system and visualize
their results with 3D plots, thus greatly speeding up their experiments.
